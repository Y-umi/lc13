// Refraction Railway — per-mob achievements, mirrored as standard
// LC13 medals so they show up in the player's profile / achievements
// HUD alongside the rest of the LC13 awards. The railway's own
// in-run `achievement_state` plumbing still drives the Starlight
// bonus; this layer is purely cosmetic / record-keeping.
//
// Granted by `AwardStarlightProgression` in
// `code/modules/refraction_railway/run_datum.dm` when an
// achievement resolves TRUE at run completion. Each Nova Flare
// `GetMobAchievements()` entry carries an `"award"` field pointing
// to one of the subtypes below.
//
// Add new entries here when authoring new railway achievements
// in `lines/<line>/achievements.dm`. Keep `database_id` keyed off a
// `MEDAL_REFRACTION_*` define in `code/__DEFINES/achievements.dm`.
