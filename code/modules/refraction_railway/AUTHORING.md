# Authoring a New Refraction Railway Line

This guide walks through every step of adding a new line to the Refraction Railway. By the end you'll have a fully playable line with custom-named nodes, mob tips, and a subway-map entry — without touching any TGUI or system code.

For the architectural overview see [README.md](README.md) in this folder.

---

## What you'll create

For one new line you author, create a subdirectory `code/modules/refraction_railway/lines/<your_line>/` containing:

1. **`<your_line>.dm`** — a `/datum/refraction_line` subtype with the line config and `AddNode(...)` calls.
2. **`passives.dm`** *(optional)* — overrides `GetMobPassives()` for the mobs your line introduces.
3. **`attacks.dm`** *(optional)* — overrides `GetMobAttacks()` for the same.

Plus one map file:

4. **`<your_line>.dmm`** under `_maps/refraction_railway/` — combat rooms + the line's checkpoint room + spawn landmarks.

And optionally:

5. **Mob tips** — registered into `SSrefraction_railway.mob_tips` at subsystem init. One-liner per mob type.

That's it. No JS edits, no subsystem edits, no console wiring, no central passive/attack registry to fight over with other line authors.

---

## Step 1 — Create the line subtype

Create a new file at `code/modules/refraction_railway/lines/<your_line>/<your_line>.dm`. Don't forget to add it to `lobotomy-corp13.dme`.

```dm
/datum/refraction_line/mirage
	id                  = "mirage"
	name                = "Line 2: Mirage"
	description         = "Doors that do not protest. Corridors that do not echo. The route appears to have been waiting on us in particular."
	map_path            = "_maps/refraction_railway/mirage.dmm"
	attribute_set_value = 80
	max_lobby_size      = 4
	section_count       = 2
	display_color       = "#d36322"
```

**Field notes:**

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `id` | Unique string. Used as the leaderboard key and as the line's identifier in URLs / logs. **Must be unique across all lines.** |
| `name` | Shown on the line selector. Keep short — there's no marquee. |
| `description` | One sentence of flavor for the sidebar. |
| `map_path` | Path to your `.dmm`. The dmm holds the combat rooms and the line-specific checkpoint room (both on the same z). |
| `attribute_set_value` | Every player's attributes are set to this for the duration of the run, then restored on exit. Determines which E.G.O. is eligible. **80** ≈ HE-tier readiness; **100** unlocks ALEPH-tier. |
| `max_lobby_size` | Hard cap on how many players can join one lobby for this line. |
| `section_count` | Number of sectors. Must match the length of `sector_briefings` you author below. |
| `display_color` | Hex color, used on the subway map and the briefing badge. |

---

## Step 2 — Configure the subway-map appearance

This is what shows up on the line-selector hub. Two lists drive it: `nodes` (positions) and `edges` (connections). Both are list-of-lists — no DM type to learn.

```dm
/datum/refraction_line/liu_compound
	// ... (fields from Step 1) ...

	map_viewbox = list("w" = 800, "h" = 400)

	nodes = list(
		list("x" = 50,  "y" = 200, "kind" = "start"),
		list("x" = 200, "y" = 200, "kind" = "combat"),
		list("x" = 350, "y" = 100, "kind" = "checkpoint"),
		list("x" = 500, "y" = 200, "kind" = "combat"),
		list("x" = 650, "y" = 200, "kind" = "boss"),
		list("x" = 750, "y" = 200, "kind" = "finish"),
	)

	edges = list(
		list("from" = 1, "to" = 2, "shape" = "line"),
		list("from" = 2, "to" = 3, "shape" = "elbow_v"),
		list("from" = 3, "to" = 4, "shape" = "elbow_v"),
		list("from" = 4, "to" = 5, "shape" = "line"),
		list("from" = 5, "to" = 6, "shape" = "curve", "dashed" = TRUE),
	)

	recommended_tier_lines = list(
		"- Bring E.G.O. with stat requirements around 80.",
	)

	recommended_tier_offset = list("x" = 40, "y" = -60)
```

**`nodes` entries:**

- `x`, `y` — SVG coordinates inside `map_viewbox`.
- `kind` — drives the node color: `"start"` (green), `"combat"` (blue), `"checkpoint"` (grey), `"boss"` (red), `"finish"` (gold). Defaults to the line's `display_color`.
- `radius` — optional, default 14 px.

**`edges` entries:**

- `from`, `to` — 1-based indices into `nodes`.
- `shape` — `"line"` (straight), `"elbow_h"` (right-angle, horizontal first), `"elbow_v"` (vertical first), `"curve"` (quadratic Bezier).
- `color` — optional hex override. Defaults to `display_color`.
- `thickness` — optional, default 4 px.
- `dashed` — optional bool; dashed strokes are commonly used to mark "danger ahead" or final-boss approach.

The "Recommended Level & Tier" panel renders next to the start node, offset by `recommended_tier_offset`. Each string in `recommended_tier_lines` becomes one rendered line.

---

## Step 3 — Define combat nodes

Override `New()` and call `AddNode(...)` once per combat node. Each call instantiates a `/datum/refraction_node` and registers it in `combat_nodes[node_id]`.

```dm
/datum/refraction_line/mirage/New()
	. = ..()

	// Sector 1
	AddNode(
		"mirage_threshold",                                   // node_id
		"mirage_threshold_spawns",                            // landmark_id (matches dmm)
		"First Stop: Threshold",                              // display name
		"Boots compress grit at intervals too regular to be coincidence. The pattern repeats. Patterns invite interruption.",
		list(                                                 // mob_stock (1-player baseline)
			/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/ordeal/steel_dawn             = 8,
			/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/ordeal/steel_dawn/steel_noon  = 4,
		),
		c_max = 4,                                            // concurrent_max
	)

	AddNode(
		"mirage_hollow",
		"mirage_hollow_spawns",
		"Station #2: Hollow",
		"Lights flicker at a pitch slightly off true. The chairs are angled as if recently vacated. The room is empty in a way that insists on being shown to be.",
		list(
			/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/ordeal/steel_dawn/steel_noon         = 3,
			/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/ordeal/steel_dawn/steel_noon/flying  = 2,
		),
		c_max = 3,
	)

	// Sector 2 — final boss
	AddNode(
		"mirage_apse",
		"mirage_apse_spawns",
		"Last Stop: Apse",
		"It does not look up. It has, perhaps, never looked up. Whatever business it conducts requires no acknowledgment of those who arrive — nor of those who do not leave.",
		list(/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/ordeal/steel_dusk = 1),
		boss = TRUE,                                          // boss flag
	)
```

**`AddNode` signature:**

```dm
AddNode(node_id, lm_id, n_name, n_desc, list/stock, c_max = 4, boss = FALSE)
```

- `node_id` — unique within this line. Used as the room_id when teleporting players in, and as the key into `combat_nodes`. Reference it from `sector_briefings` (Step 4).
- `lm_id` — every `/obj/effect/landmark/refraction/spawner` in the dmm with this same `id` becomes a valid spawn point for this node. Drop one or many landmarks per node.
- `n_name` — shown as the node card title in the briefing.
- `n_desc` — flavor text under the node name. Pass `null` if you don't want one.
- `stock` — assoc list `mob_path => 1-player baseline count`. At runtime it's multiplied by `1 + 0.20*(num_players − 1)` (boss nodes skip this).
- `c_max` — max alive at once across all spawn landmarks for this node. Default 4. Boss nodes default to 1 unless overridden.
- `boss = TRUE` — flips two things: stock no longer scales with player count, and `c_max` defaults to 1. Used for the final-fight node.

---

## Step 4 — Wire sector briefings

`sector_briefings` is an ordered list of sectors. Each sector entry is the per-sector header data plus a `node_ids` list referencing the combat nodes you defined in Step 3.

Add this inside `New()`, after the `AddNode(...)` calls:

```dm
	sector_briefings = list(
		list(
			"name"        = "Sector 1: Approach",
			"description" = "The first stop arrives before the carriage has truly started moving. Things sharpen here, though we cannot yet say into what.",
			"node_ids"    = list("mirage_threshold", "mirage_hollow"),
		),
		list(
			"name"        = "Sector 2: Reception",
			"description" = "The end is closer than we feel. Whatever waits at the apse has not turned to face us, and may never need to.",
			"node_ids"    = list("mirage_apse"),
		),
	)
```

**Field notes:**

- `node_ids` — must be **node ids you registered in Step 3**, in the order players will encounter them.
- `name` / `description` — surface in the briefing UI header above the node cards. Per-mob faction context and incoming-damage advice belong on the per-mob `mob_tips` (Step 5), not duplicated at the sector level.
- **No sector-level `faction`, `damage_hints`, or `is_boss` field.** Boss-ness is per-node — passed to `AddNode(... boss = TRUE)` and rendered on that specific node's card.

The number of entries in `sector_briefings` must equal `section_count` from Step 1. The briefing won't crash if mismatched, but the advance console will refuse to begin a sector that doesn't exist.

---

## Step 5 — Add mob tips (optional but recommended)

Tips appear on a mob's revealed card (after a player has fought it once) as a short flavor hint. They live in `SSrefraction_railway.mob_tips`, an assoc list `mob_path => tip string`, populated at subsystem init.

To add tips for your line's mobs, edit `code/modules/refraction_railway/_railway_subsystem.dm` and find `InitializeMobTips()`:

```dm
/datum/controller/subsystem/refraction_railway/proc/InitializeMobTips()
	mob_tips = list(
		// Existing entries from other lines stay here ...

		// Mirage additions:
		/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/ordeal/steel_dawn                    = "Standard G-Corp grunt — melee RED only, no special tricks. They like to surround you; pull one off to a flank instead of fighting all of them at once.",
		/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/ordeal/steel_dawn/steel_noon         = "Detonates in a small RED AoE when it dies. Land the killing blow at range, or step back two tiles before finishing the kill.",
		/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/ordeal/steel_dawn/steel_noon/flying  = "Hovers above the terrain and shoots from range. Ground melee cannot hit it — bring a ranged weapon, or wait until it lands to attack.",
		/mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/ordeal/steel_dusk                    = "WAW-tier captain that buffs every nearby G-Corp staffer's damage. Kill it first — everything else in the room loses teeth the moment it goes down.",
	)
```

**Tip rules:**

- **Be direct.** Name the mob's gimmick (the specific behavior that makes it different from a generic melee mob) and tell the player exactly what to do about it. One or two sentences is fine.
- Lead with the mechanic, not the flavor. "Detonates on death; finish it at range." reads better than "It carries something dangerous within."
- If a mob has no tip registered, the briefing card just omits the tip section (no empty box).
- Tips are global across all lines — the same mob tip shows up on whichever line uses that mob. So pick advice that applies regardless of context.

---

## Step 5b — Add mob passives (longer-form)

Where a tip is one sentence, a **passive** is a titled card with a paragraph of explanatory text and a severity indicator. Passives surface in the "Passives" section of a mob's full data sheet (revealed cards only — silhouettes don't show them).

**Where they live**: in your line's own subdirectory, in a `passives.dm` file that overrides `/datum/refraction_line/<your_line>/GetMobPassives()`. You never touch any other line's file or any central table.

```dm
// code/modules/refraction_railway/lines/mirage/passives.dm

/datum/refraction_line/mirage/GetMobPassives()
    return list(
        /mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/ordeal/steel_dawn/steel_noon = list(
            list(
                "title"    = "Last Stand",
                "severity" = "high",
                "text"     = "While attacking at 25% HP or below, 75% chance per attack to trigger Self-Destruct.",
            ),
            list(
                "title"    = "Zealous Squadmate",
                "severity" = "low",
                "text"     = "When Self-Destruct goes off, every Steel Dawn within 7 tiles becomes Zealous and is healed to nearly full.",
            ),
        ),
    )
```

The subsystem walks every registered line at init and merges all `GetMobPassives()` returns into `SSrefraction_railway.mob_passives`.

**Severity tiers** (drives banner color + warning-icon count):

| `severity` | Banner    | Icons | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `"info"`   | brown     | none  | Informational only — "has reach 2", etc. |
| `"low"`    | yellow    | ⚠     | Worth knowing; doesn't immediately threaten you. |
| `"medium"` | orange    | ⚠⚠    | Active mid-combat consideration. Telegraphed AoEs, faction synergies. |
| `"high"`   | red       | ⚠⚠⚠   | Immediately dangerous. Self-destructs, screech AoEs, boss phase shifts. |

**Passive rules:**

- One passive per gimmick — if a mob has both a self-destruct and a death buff, that's two cards.
- Player-readable language only. No proc names, type paths, variable names, or DM expressions (`view(N)`, `oview(N)`, `TemporarySpeedChange(...)`, `damage_coeff`, etc).
- A mob with no passive entry simply renders no Passives section. Empty cards are not rendered.

### Card-writing style guide (passives **and** attacks)

Write cards like a Limbus Company identity passive: terse, mechanical,
number-dense. Every clause must change what the player knows or does. This
guide is shared by `passives.dm` and `attacks.dm` (Step 5c's "same as
passives" rule points here).

**1. Lead every clause with its trigger, then state the exact effect.**
Use this real-time trigger vocabulary (our analogue of LCB's Turn Start/End):

| Write | Means |
|---|---|
| `On spawn:` / `Encounter start:` | Initialize / first Life tick |
| `Every N seconds:` | cooldown-gated recurring action |
| `On hit:` / `On its melee:` | per AttackingTarget |
| `On taking damage:` | per damage instance |
| `At <value> HP:` / `Below <value> HP:` | health threshold |
| `While <condition>:` | persistent conditional |
| `On death:` | death() / on its defeat |
| `Phase 2 (after <event>):` | staged transition, name the event |

**2. The card UI already shows the mob's data sheet** (HP, move speed,
resistance row, melee damage + type + cadence, ranged details). For
mobs with 0/0 melee the data sheet renders "no basic melee attack"
automatically. Never restate any of that in a card — including
qualitative paraphrases ("fast", "fragile", "tanky") or a redundant
"no melee" / "never attacks" line. Saying a mob is "immobile" / "can't
move" **is** allowed (the move-delay row doesn't make immobility
obvious). If a card would only restate data-sheet info, delete it.

**Give exact numbers for ability effects only — never for the mob's
own stat block.** Do state: an attack's damage value + type, radius,
cooldown/wind-up, stack counts, status duration, % thresholds
("at 50% HP"). Do **not** state: the mob's HP pool, its basic-melee
damage numbers, or any player-count / Railway scaling (HP × players,
"summons N per 2 players"), nor any run-system framing ("the node
clears", "the only registered enemy", "N spawn this node") — that
coupling belongs to the run system, not the mob. Describe only what the
mob itself does ("when it dies, every vine it spread is removed"). For basic melee write only whether it exists and what
**status / mechanical effect** it inflicts: "Has no melee attack", "Its
melee applies 3 Tremor". Do **not** state its damage type alone ("Its
melee deals RED") — the data sheet shows that. A basic-attack *replacement* (e.g. Stage-2 Slam) names
its type and scaling, not a number: `RED, scales with the target's RED
Fragile`. Numbers live in the attack card's `damage` field only — never
restate that field inside `desc`.

**3. State every cap and frequency limit** in parentheses: `(max 9)`,
`(up to 4 times)`, `(once per 1s)`, `(cap 6 alive per nest)`,
`(3 nests this node)`.

**4. Never re-explain a status — the glossary tooltip does that.**
Status names (Bleed, Tremor, RED Fragile, Defense Level Down, Sinking,
…) are auto-underlined on the card with a hover description sourced from
`status_glossary.dm`. Write only the per-card specifics: the stack count
and any gating (`applies 2 RED Fragile`, `pulses 3 Defense Level Down`).
Do **not** add `(+10% RED per stack, 10s, max 9)` — that is duplicated,
forbidden text. If a status's numbers change, fix the glossary entry.

**5. Resistances:** do **not** list a mob's static damage multipliers.
Include them only when (a) they **change** under a condition or phase —
then show each state explicitly (Stage 1 → break window → Stage 2), or
(b) the entity is a **structure / non-mob** the player otherwise cannot
read (e.g. a vine's armor table). The data sheet's resistance row covers
the static case for mobs.

**6. No flavor, no strategy, no synergy.** No prose mood ("the family
runs one plan"), no advice ("kill her first", "dodge the reticle"), and
do **not** spell out how two cards combine ("RED Fragile from ANY clown
amplifies this", "the Bleed Thornlash feeds on"). State each mechanic
once, on its own card; the player draws the conclusion. A bare factual
qualifier ("frail", "never retreats") is fine when it *is* the mechanic.

**7. State each fact once; cross-reference by bold name.** Never repeat
what another card already says. If a card needs to point at another,
name it and stop — wrap the referenced card name in `**double
asterisks**` so it renders bold (`See the **Thornlash** attack`, `same
as the Refracted Clown's **Mask Break**`). Do not describe what the
referenced card does; that is its card's job. Branch conditional effects
with `If … ; otherwise …`, exactly as the mechanic resolves.

**Bad** → `"400 HP. Its Wail (every 6s) applies 2 RED Fragile (+10% RED
damage taken per stack, 10s, max 9) and its Slam (8-12 RED) is RED, so
RED Fragile from ANY clown amplifies it — kill it fast."`
**Good** (passive) → `"Stage 1: keeps ~6 tiles away. At 50% HP the mask
breaks: 2.5s taking x0.2, then permanently Stage 2 — its basic attack
becomes **Slam**. The other clowns share this break window."`
**Good** (attack) → `Wail · "12 WHITE in a 7-tile radius, applies 2 RED
Fragile" · "~0.5s decoy + ~0.6s wind-up, then hits everything within 7
tiles and applies 2 RED Fragile."`

**Collisions**: if two lines both register passives for the same mob path, the *first* line to be loaded wins; the second's contribution is dropped with a `stack_trace` naming both lines. So if you reuse a mob another line already covers, just don't redeclare it — your line will inherit the existing entries automatically.

---

## Step 5c — Add mob attacks

The Attacks section renders **above** Passives on a revealed mob card. Use it for discrete damage-dealing actions beyond basic melee — screeches, dashes, AoE slams, conditional self-destructs. Each attack is a four-field assoc list.

**Where they live**: in your line's own subdirectory, in an `attacks.dm` file that overrides `/datum/refraction_line/<your_line>/GetMobAttacks()`:

```dm
// code/modules/refraction_railway/lines/mirage/attacks.dm

/datum/refraction_line/mirage/GetMobAttacks()
    return list(
        /mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/ordeal/steel_dusk = list(
            list(
                "name"     = "Screech",
                "damage"   = "60 WHITE in a 10-tile radius",
                "cooldown" = "15 seconds",
                "desc"     = "Spends 5 seconds winding up — cannot move or attack during this time. On release, blasts a shockwave that hits everything in the area.",
            ),
        ),
    )
```

Same load + merge + collision flow as passives.

**Cooldown conventions** (free-form, but stay consistent):

- Clean interval: `"15 seconds"` / `"4 seconds"`
- Always-on: `"Replaces basic melee"`
- Trigger-driven: `"Triggered (see Last Stand)"` — name the passive that arms it
- Conditional + interval: `"15 seconds, 30% chance per attack"`
- Stage-locked: append `", Stage 2 only"`

**Cross-referencing with passives**: when a passive arms or gates an attack, write the passive as the *trigger only* and let the attack carry the mechanics. For example:

```dm
// passives.dm
list(
    "title"    = "Last Stand",
    "severity" = "high",
    "text"     = "While attacking at 25% HP or below, 75% chance per attack to trigger Self-Destruct.",
)
```

```dm
// attacks.dm
list(
    "name"     = "Self-Destruct",
    "damage"   = "60 RED in a 3-tile radius",
    "cooldown" = "Triggered (see Last Stand)",
    "desc"     = "Stops moving. Grows to nearly 2x size with a red glow over 1.5 seconds. Then explodes, hitting everything close to it.",
)
```

The passive references the attack by name; the attack references the passive by name. Players reading either card find their way to the other.

**Style rules**: follow the **Card-writing style guide** in Step 5b — it
applies verbatim to attacks (lead with the trigger, exact numbers, caps,
define statuses once, omit static resistances, no flavor/strategy). Plus:

- Player-readable language only. Tiles, seconds, HP, "winds up", "stunned", "moves faster".
- No proc names, type paths, variable names, or DM expressions.
- `damage`/`cooldown` are their own fields — keep them exact; `desc` carries the wind-up, conditions, caps, and status definitions.

---

## Step 6 — Author the `.dmm`

This is the only non-DM step. The dmm holds:

### Combat rooms

For each combat node (each `AddNode` call you made):

- One or more **`/obj/effect/landmark/refraction/spawner`** with `id` matching the node's `landmark_id`. Drop them where you want mobs to materialize.
- One **`/obj/effect/landmark/refraction/start_point`** with `id = "<node_id>"` per player slot — these are the tiles players are forceMoved onto when entering the room.

For per-line authoring, prefer typed subtypes that bake `id` into the path (see `lines/nova_flare/landmarks.dm` for the pattern). StrongDMM treats them as standard obj paths and there's nothing to override per-tile.

**No section-end or finish landmarks needed.** A sector ends automatically once the last node's mobs are all dead (the controller fires `RoomCleared`, `AdvanceRoom` finds no next room, and `OnSectionCleared` runs). After the 5-second breather, the team is teleported to the checkpoint area. The same path runs the final-results display + cleanup when the last sector clears.

### Checkpoint room (one per line)

Same z as the combat rooms, reachable only via teleport:

- 4–6 **`/obj/effect/landmark/refraction/checkpoint_spawn`** turfs (player arrival points; spread them out so the team doesn't pile on one tile).
- 1 **`/obj/structure/refraction_briefing`** (wall display showing the upcoming sector).
- 2–3 **`/obj/machinery/computer/refraction_loadout`** consoles (parallel access avoids queueing).
- 1 **`/obj/machinery/computer/refraction_advance`** ("Begin Sector" console).

### Visual conventions

Spawn landmarks use icon_state `"x3"`; player-spawn / checkpoint-spawn use `"x2"` / `"x3"`. They all live on `'icons/effects/landmarks_static.dmi'`. They're invisible to players in-round.

---

## Quick checklist

Before you commit:

- [ ] `id` is unique across all `/datum/refraction_line` subtypes.
- [ ] `section_count` equals `length(sector_briefings)`.
- [ ] Every node id in `sector_briefings.node_ids` was created via `AddNode(...)`.
- [ ] Every node's `landmark_id` has at least one matching `/obj/effect/landmark/refraction/spawner` (`id` set) in the dmm.
- [ ] Every combat room has a `start_point` landmark with `id` matching the node id.
- [ ] The checkpoint room has briefing display, advance console, ≥ 2 loadout consoles, ≥ 4 checkpoint_spawn tiles.
- [ ] The dmm is included via `lobotomy-corp13.dme` (under the `_maps` block).
- [ ] Your line subtype file is included via `lobotomy-corp13.dme` (under `code/modules/refraction_railway/lines/`).
- [ ] Compile is clean (`dm.exe lobotomy-corp13.dme`).

## Common gotchas

- **"My line doesn't appear on the hub."** — Either `id` is empty (the subsystem filters those), or you forgot to `#include` the file in the DME, or another line claimed the same `id`.
- **"Mobs spawn but the room never clears."** — Almost always a `landmark_id` typo: the spawn landmarks in the dmm don't match any node's `landmark_id`, so the controller has zero spawn points for that node and immediately reports the room empty *before* spawning anything. Double-check both sides.
- **"Boss spawns 4 of itself instead of 1."** — You forgot `boss = TRUE` on the boss node's `AddNode`, so `c_max` is still 4. Boss nodes auto-default `c_max` to 1 when `boss = TRUE`.
- **"Mob counts feel off at 4 players."** — Per-mob stock is multiplied by `1 + 0.20 × (num_players − 1)` and rounded. So `8` becomes `~10`, `4` becomes `~5`. If you want exact authored counts regardless of lobby size, the mob is probably a mini-boss → use `boss = TRUE`.
- **"Mob cards show empty tip boxes."** — Tips are optional; if no entry exists in `mob_tips` for a mob path, the card just omits the tip section. You'll only see "empty boxes" if you accidentally registered an empty string. Use the actual fix or omit the entry.
- **"Players say the briefing shows the wrong sector."** — The briefing reads `current_section + 1` (the *upcoming* sector), not the current one. Sector 1's briefing shows BEFORE players begin Sector 1, so it's correct that they see the Sector 1 entry while still in the checkpoint.

## Where to look when something breaks

- Spawning bug → `code/modules/refraction_railway/wave_system.dm`
- Briefing rendering bug → `tgui/packages/tgui/interfaces/RefractionBriefing.js` + `code/modules/refraction_railway/checkpoint_consoles.dm`
- Subway map bug → `tgui/packages/tgui/interfaces/RefractionRailway.js`
- Lobby / lane management bug → `code/modules/refraction_railway/_railway_subsystem.dm` + `run_datum.dm`
- Persistence bug → `code/controllers/subsystem/persistence.dm` (the four `*RefractionLeaderboards` / `*RefractionEncounters` procs)
