/*
 * Nova Flare mob passives, returned by GetMobPassives().
 * Each entry: list("title", "severity", "text").
 * severity: info / low / medium / high. See AUTHORING.md Step 5b.
 *
 * Card-writing rules (see AUTHORING.md):
 *  - The card UI already shows the mob's data sheet (HP, move speed,
 *    resistance row, melee damage + type + cadence, ranged details).
 *    For mobs with 0/0 melee the data sheet renders "no basic melee
 *    attack" automatically. Never restate any of that in a card —
 *    including qualitative paraphrases ("fast", "fragile", "tanky") or
 *    a redundant "no melee" / "never attacks" line. Saying a mob is
 *    "immobile" / "can't move" IS allowed (the data sheet's move-delay
 *    row doesn't make immobility obvious).
 *  - Never state a mob's HP pool or basic-melee damage numbers nor its
 *    melee damage TYPE, nor any player-count / railway scaling. Say
 *    only what its melee INFLICTS (status / mechanical effect, e.g.
 *    "applies 3 Tremor"). Percentage thresholds are fine.
 *  - Never re-explain a status the glossary defines (Bleed, Tremor, RED
 *    Fragile, Defense Level Down, ...). Name it; the hover does the rest.
 *  - Never repeat what another card says, and never spell out the synergy
 *    between cards. State each effect once; refer to other cards by name,
 *    wrapping the referenced card name in **double asterisks** so it
 *    renders bold.
