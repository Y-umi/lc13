/*
 * Curtain Call — zeal_s2n2: Greed Touched Eric.T.
 * A bloody clone of the friendly clinic NPC Eric.T (his deepest greed made
 * flesh). Pure summoner; conjures hordes of greed-touched and X-Corp mobs
 * whose deaths blood-beam their lifeblood back to him. Once his bloodfeast
 * pool fills, he detonates the room in a Greed Burst, sacrificing every
 * live summon and dropping his shield for a vulnerable window. Shield is
 * the friendly Eric's flat-subtract /obj/effect/temp_visual/blood_shield
 * pattern (eric_t.dm:791), with blood_resistance scaled by pool size.
