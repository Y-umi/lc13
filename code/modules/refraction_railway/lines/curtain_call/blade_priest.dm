/*
 * Curtain Call — zeal_s4n1: The Distorted Priest.
 *
 * A hooded body puppeted by an escort of orbiting blades. Lore is in
 * lore_notes.md; for implementation purposes the priest is a single
 * HP pool — the blades are weapons, not separate kill targets, so
 * the body falling ends the fight regardless of how many blades are alive.
 *
 * Core gimmick: every cast of Blade Dash detaches one orbit blade,
 * draws a free-angle line from the priest through the target (extending
 * past so the total line is at least 7 tiles long), telegraphs for 0.8s,
 * and dashes the blade through it for BLACK damage. The blade hovers
 * at the landing tile for 3 seconds, then chains into another dash on
 * a fresh nearby human (dash_chain_length times) before returning to
 * orbit. Two extra abilities — Sermon Volley (every blade dashes in
 * rapid sequence) and Verdict's Cage (blades park around a player and
 * all dash inward) — escalate the pressure.
 *
 * Skull Mark: the priest periodically tags one human with a skull
 * overlay; marked players are preferred targets for every blade
 * ability until the mark expires.
 *
 * Phase scaling: starting with 2 blades, gains +1 each time HP drops
 * past 80/60/40/20%, capped at 6.
 *
 * Body Sweep: short-range 5x5 BLACK knockback AoE on the body itself,
 * triggered when humans are close enough — adapted from azarus's
 * HouseEdge.
