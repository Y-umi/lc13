/*
 * Line 2: Curtain Call. Five-sector run themed as a five-act play staged by
 * an unseen Game Master, Serio Zeal. Every combat node is a boss fight;
 * Serio Zeal is the final node of the last sector.
 *
 * This pass is scaffolding only — combat nodes use a placeholder
 * /mob/living/simple_animal/hostile/netherworld/migo/refracted stock so the
 * line is end-to-end playable for layout / briefing / leaderboard testing
 * while the real per-encounter bosses are authored elsewhere.
 *
 * Subway-map layout: 16 visual nodes (start + 8 boss-combat + 4 checkpoints
 * + 2 boss-wave finale nodes + finish) positioned to evoke the Sculptor
 * constellation rather than a horizontal snake. Authoring conventions: see
 * code/modules/refraction_railway/AUTHORING.md.
