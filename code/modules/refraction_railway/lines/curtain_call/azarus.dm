/*
 * Curtain Call - zeal_s1n2: Azarus, the House.
 * A gambling demon staged by the Game Master. Reuses the lavaland Herald
 * sprites. Its fight is a dice mini-game: Azarus scatters oversized dice
 * (each starting on 1, kept 2+ tiles apart); shooting or striking one spins
 * it (3s) onto a random face. The table total weakens the unavoidable Wager
 * and each landing buys time before it fires.
 *
 * Rolling is risky: a roll can draw a Snake Eyes, and every die slams the
 * floor for BLACK damage when it lands (3x3, scaling with the face; 5x5 on a
 * 6). All of Azarus's attacks deal BLACK except the Wager (PALE). The
 * dealer's own AoEs knock loose any die showing 4+ for a fresh spin.
 *
 * After a Wager resolves the whole table clears for a 15s dead window, then
 * re-deals. Taking damage rushes the Wager clock. Phase 2 (<=50% HP) forces
 * any pending Wager off, then conjures four stationary mirror-doubles that
 * mimic the dealer's attacks; each has 25% of his HP and is broken normally.
