/*
 * Curtain Call — zeal_s3n2: The Snow Cabin.
 *
 * The cabin protects its master by morphing into a dream-place that
 * eats its visitors. Theme: flesh + snow fused. Players fight inside a
 * 15x10 arena pre-built by the mapper. Floor weakpoints / hatching events
 * land on any open turf (mouths, meatpods, ice prisons) except the snow
 * and ice variants the cabin can't pierce; eyes mount on any closed wall
 * except the fakeglass — see IsValidFloorTile / IsValidWallTile. The
 * cabin itself is an
 * invisible controller mob; players damage it only through weakpoints
 * it spits up onto the floor (eyes + mouths). On a separate Phase 2
 * timer it also spawns environmental hatching events that disgorge
 * meatling and yagaslave minions.
 *
 * All tuning lives as `var/`s on the cabin mob itself — refracted
 * subtypes override what they need. Subordinate classes (mouth, meatpod,
 * ice_prison) keep a `parent_cabin` ref and read their durations through
 * it so retuning happens in one place.
