/*
 * Curtain Call — zeal_s5n2 (serio_zeal_w2): Phase 2 of the Serio Zeal
 * finale. Two mobs cooperate to form the encounter:
 *
 *   - The Crystal: holds Star sealed inside. Only kill target. Alternates
 *     between Blue (sealed, immune) and Red (exposed, vulnerable). Red
 *     fires when the Overseer invokes a memory attack, plus an
 *     afterglow tail.
 *   - The Overseer: patrols around the Crystal, defending it with light
 *     pressure (Blue-phase) attacks and triggering the Crystal's memory
 *     attacks (Red windows). Cannot be killed — its stagger HP can be
 *     broken to knock it down, weakening the next memory attack, then
 *     it stands back up with full stagger HP after a fixed delay.
 *
 * See serio_brainstorm.md ("Phase 2 — The Overseer: The Seal") for the
 * full design: three HP brackets (Stage / Group / Confession), Blue/Red
 * damage gate, knockdown lever, mental decay / mental detonate status
 * loop, per-bracket Red-window attack pools.
 *
 * This pass adds the encounter framework: patrol AI, three Blue-phase
 * pressure attacks (Glance / Cold Word / Patrol Trail), memory
 * invocation cycle with per-bracket attack pool selection, status
 * effect plumbing, monologue system, bracket transitions. The per-
 * bracket memory attacks are STUBBED — each one currently just flips
 * the Crystal to red for the right duration with a flavor message;
 * concrete mechanics get filled in pass-by-pass.
 *
 * Sprites (placeholder):
 *   Crystal:   icons/effects/96x96.dmi state "smoke2" (96x96, needs
 *              pixel_x/y = -32 to center on the 32x32 tile)
