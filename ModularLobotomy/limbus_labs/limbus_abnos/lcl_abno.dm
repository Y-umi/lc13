/*
* DESIRE LOSS
* Was going to make these defines but too much -IP
* ---
* The loss of hunger and desire is naturally 1/10th
* of the max hunger and desire.
* Hunger is lost 1/10th every minute.
* Hunger can be estimated easily by altering diet_value
* to any fraction of max hunger.
* Hunger allows the Abnormality to heal by 10% per check.
* By default hunger does not reduce desire.
* desire_on_eat_threshold is when you cannot gain desire
* from feeding past this hunger value.
* ---
* Desire is lost 1/20th every minute.
* by default it is effected by:
* >Hunger			>Items in the room
* >Damage it takes	>Each sentence spoken
8 >Physical petting	>Eating
* ---
* Insight is determined by counting all liked and unliked
* items in a 5 tile radius of the abnormality.
* Liked objects amount times liked_objects_value
* minus hated obj times hated_objects_value
* equals a room score every minute.
* By default the room score is added to desire.
* This can result in situations where a abnormality has so
* many liked objects that it offsets their desire loss.
* ---
* Every 10 seconds a abnormality generates
* ego accumulation. When it reaches 100
* accumulation it will be able to produce
* ego at will. If desire is less than the
* accumulation then no accumulation will be
* generated.
* ---
* Currently the counter is not intigrated by
* default into any of these procs and need
* to be uniquely edited into abnormalities.
